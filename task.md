Coding task brief

- Using the public API documentation  http://demo.infiny.cloud/api-documentation connect to the Infiny API and display a list of “CloudLX” services in an account. It should be possible to navigate through to a new page/view showing the details of the service, to include service name, port name, service status and any other details returned by the API that you think are useful.

 

- The code should be written to a high standard of modern PHP. You can optionally use any framework/packages you wish.

- The code should be publicly available online, so we can review it after you have created it. You can choose to do this in anyway you see fit.

- You can use any method you like to connect to the API. However, the method and approach chosen is core to what we will be reviewing.

- The front end display of services does not need to be overly pretty - but should be comprehensible and outputted to the browser as valid HTML and CSS.

- The finished code should be able to be downloaded and run in a standard LAMP stack.

 

A user account will be created for you shortly on the demo platform that already has a set of services configured on it. You should receive a welcome email where you can set your password and which you can use for UI and API access to the demo platform.
